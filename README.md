# AI Pothole API

This is the backend API layer that interfaces with our PostgreSQL database for the UCF AI Pothole Detection project.

## Development
First, you need to secure the .env from a team member, probably ask @twallie.
Once you have it, clone the project and insert the `.env` to the root folder.

The project was developed using Bun, so we will refer to it for installing.
[Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To start:

```bash
bun run start
```
